										Do you ever experience the desire to learn coding techniques or new technologies, yet find yourself caught in a cycle of procrastination? Watching endless tutorials to just end up frustrated? I have been there and I know it can be discouraging. But, rest assured, in this article I am going to share the antidote to this vicious cycle of inaction or what some developers call <i>“The Tutorial Hell”.</i>
									<br/>
									<p>
										First, let me clarify something — I'm not against tutorials or online classes. However, I do want to raise awareness about the potential drawbacks of not applying the newly acquired knowledge. After all, we all require a starting point. Learning how to code or conduct data analysis is similar to riding a bike. You can’t gain bike-riding skills solely from reading a book or watching a YouTube video; you must actually mount a bike and pedal through the discomfort of the possibility of falling. You won’t feel comfortable with a new technology or coding language until you get your hands dirty and build something.
									<br/>
									</p>
									<h3><b>“You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.” — Zig Ziglar</b></h3>
									<p>
										I'm not claiming to be an expert, I've only been in the field for 3 years. However, I want to share insights into this method, which has propelled me into exponential leaps of knowledge and I believe you can benefit from it as well.
									<br/>
									</p>
									<p>
										The method consists of choosing the right project for you, but, how do you choose the right project? I approach this by asking myself two questions:
										<ul>
											<li>Is there anything I could code to make my life easier?</li>
											<li>What am I curious about, what do I want to learn more about?</li>
										</ul>
										I believe these two questions have massive potential to release immense creative energy because they are connected with who you are, your curiosities and the obstacles you are facing. Constructing a project that's interwoven with your personal essence will fuel your motivation, as opposed to a cookie-cutter project from Kaggle or GitHub. If you want to learn more about this, I encourage you to keep reading!
									</p>
									<h2><b>Code Away The Troubles</b></h2>
									<p>
										Embracing the “Code Away The Troubles” mindset requires you to pay close attention to your surroundings. What is causing discomfort? Are there any aspects of your everyday life you'd like to change or mend?
									</p>
									<p>
										In order to achieve great learning progress, you have to believe that every problem has a solution. For example, perhaps you want to learn a new language, leading you to leverage Alexa's API to build a language quiz to practice. Or possibly you desire to become more productive, so you could code your own personalized to-do list app. As you adopt the mindset of the <i>"problem solver"</i> you'll recognize that most problems can be solved with some code, exposing you to valuable experience.
									<br/>
									</p>
									<p>
										Search the web for an API that can be useful to you or get inspiration from someone who navigated similar obstacles to yours. Remember, most problems can be solved with a simple google search.
									<br/>
									</p>
									<p>
										Allow me to share my own personal experience when adopting the “Code Away the Troubles” mindset. I enjoy working out, and I use a smartwatch to track my exercise. However it fell short providing the statistics that I needed. Eager to delve deeper, I leveraged its API infrastructure to develop my own <a href="https://medium.com/@manuelelizaldi/pystrava-using-machine-learning-and-dashboarding-to-achieve-my-fitness-goals-6b1bfcbfeafd">workout dashboard</a>. This dashboard displayed the information that I was looking for and allowed me in a sense, to achieve two goals at once. Not only did I create a tool aligned to my needs, but I also employed the project to gain proficiency in Google Looker. Initially I attempted to learn it through tutorials and randomly building, yet no learning progress was gained. The turning point arrived when I linked the goal to crafting the workout dashboard. This Objective-driven approach infused my learning journey with structure and gave me immense learning progress. Every challenge is an opportunity for growth and learning.
									<br>
									</p>
									<p>
										So, to summarize:
										<ol>
											<li>Pay attention to your surroundings.</li>
											<li>Have confidence in finding coding solutions.</li>
											<li>Set clear learning goals.</li>
											<li>Leverage public APIs and seek inspiration from others.</li>
										</ol>
									</p>


									<h2><b>Explore Your Curiosity Through Code</b></h2>
									<h3><b>“Curiosity is the wick in the candle of learning.” — William Arthur Ward</b></h3>
									<p>
									Learning driven by curiosity can be one of the most rewarding experiences. It takes us back to those moments in high school when certain books felt like a chore to read. However, years later, these same stories became fascinating. This transformation happens because we were curious, not compelled.
									<br>
									<br>
									When you embark on a journey to learn something that genuinely intrigues you, it’s a game-changer. There’s no pressure; it’s all about the joy of exploration. Whether it’s diving into a code project, immersing yourself in a subject, or crafting a unique app, time seems to slip away.
									<br>
									<br>
									Imagine you’re passionate about a sport, or perhaps you’re deeply concerned about global warming. With coding, you can transform these interests into actionable projects. Want to know more about a sport? Dive into the available datasets and build an app that offers insights and information you crave. Concerned about climate change? Code an app that provides real-time weather updates.
									<br>
									<br>
									On a personal note, I’m a coffee aficionado. When I relocated to the vibrant city of Austin, Texas, I was eager to explore its rich coffee culture. With no one to guide me, I took this on my own hands and made this journey even more exciting. I leveraged Yelp’s API and my coding skills. The result? My very own <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/manuel8857/viz/CoffeShopsAustin/Sheet1">coffee shop map.</a>
									<br>
									<br>
									But that’s not where my curiosity stops. Recently, I’ve developed an interest in delving into the world of cultural artifacts found in museums. In pursuit of this interest, I once again delved into the treasure trove of public datasets and APIs available to me, allowing me to embark on a fascinating study.
									<br>
									<br>
									So, I invite you to seek within and answer the question: What am I curious about? The possibilities are endless, don’t be afraid to explore. Once you start you’ll be hooked and will want to quench that thirst for knowledge. You’ll find that this is the key to unlocking a world of endless wonder and learning.

								<h2><b>With A Little Help From My Friend: ChatGPT</b></h2>
								<br>
							<p>
								Let’s suppose the last two approaches for choosing a project don’t work for you. Rest assured, ChatGPT is at your service. AI shouldn’t be feared, quite the opposite. This is an amazing tool that can aid you in your learning journey.
							<br>
							<br>
							ChatGPT can streamline the project selection process. Here’s my approach:
							<ol>
								<li>I begin by compiling a list of technologies or programming languages I wish to practice.</li>
								<li>Next, I note down topics that genuinely pique my interest.</li>
								<li>With this list, I formulate a straightforward prompt for ChatGPT. I ask it to generate project ideas that align with my chosen topics and involve the technologies I want to study.</li>
								<li>This method ensures that the project ideas I receive are tailored to my learning goals and preferences.</li>
							</ol>
